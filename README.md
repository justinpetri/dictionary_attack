# dictionary_attack
FTP, HTTPS, SSH protocol dictionary attack.

The user must install or create a password list file. That .txt file could then be imported into the main.py file where it can be used to perform a dictionary attack. There are three different scans: FTP, HTTPS, and SSH. Uncomment a pair of concurrent.futures and executor.map lines to use the scanner for the corresponding protocol.
